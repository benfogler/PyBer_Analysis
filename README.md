# Rideshare_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This analysis consisted of 2 datasets that we merged into 1 dataframe. The goal was to use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph showing the total weekly fares by city type. We could then leverage this data and analysis to make recommendations. 


## Results of Project
From the multiple-line chart we are able to determine:

	1. Urban Cities maintain a higher fare than Suburban and Rural
	
	2. City types with a great population result in a higher total fare, while smaller populations result in a almost half less total fare from the greater populations

	3. Regardless of city type, the end of February all had peak fares.

## Summary
Based on the results the following would be recommended:

	1. Create a more granular dataset that recognizes fare cost per mile. This will allow you to see if there is a disparity the in price difference between city types, or if there are more miles driven by city type.

	2. Increase the rides per driver in Urban areas, and possibly increase the driver count in rural areas.

	3. Along with recommendation one, looking into demographics could yield useful information. If you have an understanding of age, gender, etc. you can target how you want to market to those individuals and their needs.
